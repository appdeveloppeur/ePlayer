High
====
- MPNowPlayingInfoCenter
- Change append popup to be above/below.
- songs should display length in EntryCell (and folders show sum (or count)?)
- show album art next to entry of a playlist that is all from one album?
    - Individual songs should always show art if available.
    - album view - show like ipod app (album art, summary at top, etc.)
        - playlist should try to detect this and do the same.
- Icon

Medium
======
- Is the scrubber disabled with an empty queue (or nil currentPlayer).
    - disable scrubber
- playlist controller: click on song should play it or something (like track controller).
- Paste button should have a # indicating the number of items.
- Delete should show how many items (recursively).
- restore state of selected tab/etc
- handle MPMediaLibraryDidChangeNotification?
    - Resync at start?  Or manual?
- When paused, change scrubber thumb to red.
- Queue tab icon - change speaker icon to not have arcs when not playing.
- re-instate max 1-sec scrubber update rate.
- Creating orphan folder from player does not update playlists table view.
    Would be best to have a dirty flag on a folder, and have viewwillappear check it.

Low
===
- del/cut/copy/paste do not update playCount/playDate/addDate/releaseDate
- Fix alpha sorting so that !Uno! sorts correctly
- Editing buttons should have some images.  "rename" needs "selected" image.
- scrubber is a little sloppy.
  - Letting go, it jumps around sometimes.
- resize entrycell title width to attach to accessory view (disclosure obscures if section indexes).
- Deal with suffle and repeat.
- Docs say that AVAudioPlayer automatically enables/disables audio session, but
  recommend that you manually enable/disable as well?
- Not entirely comfortable with saving on entering background.  Ideas:
    - Save in background thread.  Would require synchronization work.
    - Save while idle?

Ideas
=====
- Sort on play counts?
- Should del/cut/copy/paste buttons somehow be static (don't scroll with table)?
- scrubber should pop up audio visualization.
- Not entirely happy that an entry can't be in a folder more than once.  However,
  I don't have an immediate need for that.  Can workaround with subfolders.
