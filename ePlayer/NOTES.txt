- CoreData debugging:
  Product -> Edit Scheme -> Run APP -> Arguments -> -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1
- scrubber is a little sloppy.
  - Letting go, it jumps around sometimes.

============
Left Off
============
Adding sort order for other controllers.
    Finish checking hasSortCell, returning correct values.
    On click "Sort Order":
        hasSortCell=YES
        "insert"
        scroll to the sort order cell.
        Change button text to "Done".
            Clicking with switch it back to "Sort Order".
            hasSortCell=NO
            "remove" sort cell
    touchSortOrder should also:
        set hasSortCell=NO and
         fix the "Sort Order" button.
         remove sort cell

TODO:
- switch to black status bar
- resize entrycell title width to attach to accessory view (disclosure obscures if section indexes).
- press and hold play to append.
- folder of songs only should be sorted manually only (by track #) in playlist
- restore state of selected tab/etc
- show album art next to entry of a playlist that is all from one album?
- album view: show art next to name
- MANUAL sort order for a folder.  Default on import is track order.
    - Display index number in manual sort order next to track name.
        - Display in columns like queue view?
- Display track length next to songs in browser.
- album view - show like ipod app (album art, summary at top, etc.)
- bring back custom header, don't rename tab ("Sort Order").
- if only 1 (or 2?) section, don't show section/indexes.

- never played entries have play year of "1"?
- queue:
    - change color of status bar to black
    - change color of nav bar to black
    - remove side scroller of table view?
    - After rearrange, update cell queue # label
- Play All entry at the top of each list?
- Play icon into table list -- should have transparent background (highlight looks weird).
    - make play button full height (44?) of table cell
- handle MPMediaLibraryDidChangeNotification?


- timer fired when opening queue, even if nothing playing.
- timer keeps firing when leaving queue

- "playback stopped" or "now playing set to nil" should stop timer.
- Fix sorting. ****
    - Finish artists/albums (and "tracks")
- Show "play" icon next to currently playing item.
- When first bringing up the queue, initialize display from ipod player queue.
- When paused, change scrubber thumb to red.
- Handle clicking an item in the queue.

- Playlist editing/saving.
  - Fix background cell color alternating while rearranging.
- Bring back loadData.
- Fix alpha sorting so that !Uno! sorts correctly


FUTURE
======
- scrubber should pop up audio visualization.
