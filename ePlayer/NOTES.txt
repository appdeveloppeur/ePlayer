NOW
===
- re-instate max 1-sec scrubber update rate.
- consider making duration in the db (or at least a property on song to get from mediaItem)..
    - Currently really broken.
- save currentQueueIndex to disk
- a song in a playlist twice won't work.  May need to use intermediate table.
- do play counts update with AVAudioPlayer?
- Is the scrubber disabled with an empty queue (or nil currentPlayer).
    - disable scrubber

High
====
- press and hold play to append.
- Adding songs is slow.  If it can't be sped up, give some visual feedback.
- songs should display length in EntryCell (and folders show sum (or count)?)
- show album art next to entry of a playlist that is all from one album?
    - Individual songs should always show art if available.
    - album view - show like ipod app (album art, summary at top, etc.)
        - playlist should try to detect this and do the same.
- Queue editing
    - Remove
    - Rearrange
    - Save
        - Update or new?
    - Don't forget to update left-column numbers after edit.
    - Fix background cell color alternating while rearranging.
- Some way to view lyrics.
- Icon
- Paste with something that already exists, maybe make a copy?

Medium
======
- playlist controller: click on song should play it or something (like track controller).
- Paste button should have a # indicating the number of items.
- Delete should show how many items (recursively).
- restore state of selected tab/etc
- handle MPMediaLibraryDidChangeNotification?
    - Resync at start?  Or manual?
- When paused, change scrubber thumb to red.
- Queue tab icon - change speaker icon to not have arcs when not playing.

Low
===
- del/cut/copy/paste do not update playCount/playDate/addDate/releaseDate
- Fix alpha sorting so that !Uno! sorts correctly
- Editing buttons should have some images.  "rename" needs "selected" image.
- scrubber is a little sloppy.
  - Letting go, it jumps around sometimes.
- resize entrycell title width to attach to accessory view (disclosure obscures if section indexes).
- Deal with suffle and repeat.
- Docs say that AVAudioPlayer automatically enables/disables audio session, but
  recommend that you manually enable/disable as well?

Ideas
=====
- Should del/cut/copy/paste buttons somehow be static (don't scroll with table)?
- scrubber should pop up audio visualization.
