- CoreData debugging:
  Product -> Edit Scheme -> Run APP -> Arguments -> -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1
- scrubber is a little sloppy.
  - Letting go, it jumps around sometimes.
- Clicking "Edit", should the 2 cells (sort/insert) go into a special "0" 
  section, and all sections get offset by +1?

TODO:
- player timer starts on launch if music playing

- Editing buttons should have some images.  "rename" needs "selected" image.
- Paste button should have a # indicating the number of items.
- Delete should show how many items (recursively).
- Paste needs to check for loops.
- Can clicking on edit button hide the tab bar?
- Should del/cut/copy/paste buttons somehow be static (don't scroll with table)?

- updating playDate
- play tapped artist/album/track
- in playlist view, hit "edit", should disable "go back" button.
- resize entrycell title width to attach to accessory view (disclosure obscures if section indexes).
- press and hold play to append.
- folder of songs only should be sorted manually only (by track #) in playlist
- restore state of selected tab/etc
- show album art next to entry of a playlist that is all from one album?
- album view: show art next to name
- MANUAL sort order for a folder.  Default on import is track order.
    - Display index number in manual sort order next to track name.
        - Display in columns like queue view?
- Display track length next to songs in browser.
- album view - show like ipod app (album art, summary at top, etc.)
- bring back custom header, don't rename tab ("Sort Order").
- if only 1 (or 2?) section, don't show section/indexes.

- never played entries have play year of "1"?
- queue:
    - remove side scroller of table view?
    - After rearrange, update cell queue # label
- Play All entry at the top of each list?
- Play icon into table list -- should have transparent background (highlight looks weird).
    - make play button full height (44?) of table cell
- handle MPMediaLibraryDidChangeNotification?


- timer fired when opening queue, even if nothing playing.
- timer keeps firing when leaving queue

- "playback stopped" or "now playing set to nil" should stop timer.
- Fix sorting. ****
    - Finish artists/albums (and "tracks")
- Show "play" icon next to currently playing item.
- When first bringing up the queue, initialize display from ipod player queue.
- When paused, change scrubber thumb to red.
- Handle clicking an item in the queue.

- Playlist editing/saving.
  - Fix background cell color alternating while rearranging.
- Bring back loadData.
- Fix alpha sorting so that !Uno! sorts correctly


FUTURE
======
- scrubber should pop up audio visualization.
