- CoreData debugging:
  Product -> Edit Scheme -> Run APP -> Arguments -> -com.apple.CoreData.SQLDebug 1
- scrubber is a little sloppy.
  - Letting go, it jumps around sometimes.


TODO:
- artist/album/track view: don't show sections if less than 10 (like playlist)
- show album art next to entry of a playlist that is all from one album?
- album view: show art next to name
- MANUAL sort order for a folder.  Default on import is track order.
    - Display index number in manual sort order next to track name.
        - Display in columns like queue view?
- Display track length next to songs in browser.
- album view - show like ipod app (album art, summary at top, etc.)
- bring back custom header, don't rename tab ("Sort Order").
- if only 1 (or 2?) section, don't show section/indexes.

- never played entries have play year of "1"?
- queue:
    - change color of status bar to black
    - change color of nav bar to black
    - remove side scroller of table view?
    - After rearrange, update cell queue # label
- Play All entry at the top of each list?
- Play icon into table list -- should have transparent background (highlight looks weird).
    - make play button full height (44?) of table cell
- handle MPMediaLibraryDidChangeNotification?


- timer fired when opening queue, even if nothing playing.
- timer keeps firing when leaving queue

- "playback stopped" or "now playing set to nil" should stop timer.
